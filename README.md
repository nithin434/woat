## Detailed Configuration

### 1. Contact Management (`smart_whatsapp_bot.js` - Lines 11-12)

Control which contacts receive automated responses:

```javascript
const MONITOR_CONTACTS = ["ALL"]; // Options:
// ["ALL"] - Respond to everyone
// ["Contact Name", "+91XXXXXXXXXX", "Another Contact"] - Specific contacts
// [] - Respond to no one

const DO_NOT_REPLY_CONTACTS = [" "]; // Blacklist contacts:
// ["Spam Contact", "+91XXXXXXXXXX", "Group Admin"] - Never reply to these
// [" "] - Empty blacklist (reply to all monitored contacts)
```

**Configuration Examples:**
- **Respond to everyone except spam**: `MONITOR_CONTACTS = ["ALL"]`, `DO_NOT_REPLY_CONTACTS = ["Spam User", "Marketing Bot"]`
- **Family and friends only**: `MONITOR_CONTACTS = ["Mom", "Dad", "Best Friend", "+91XXXXXXXXXX"]`
- **Specific numbers**: `MONITOR_CONTACTS = ["+919876543210", "+918765432109"]`

### 2. AI Response Settings (`smart_whatsapp_bot.js` - Lines 13-15)

Configure response behavior and fallback messages:

```javascript
const USE_AI_RESPONSES = true; // true = AI responses, false = simple auto-reply
const SIMPLE_REPLY = "Custom fallback message when AI is disabled";
const AI_INTRODUCTION = "Your custom AI introduction message";
```

**Customization Options:**
- **AI_INTRODUCTION**: First message sent to new contacts (sent only once)
- **SIMPLE_REPLY**: Fallback when AI fails or is disabled
- **USE_AI_RESPONSES**: Toggle between AI and simple responses

### 3. Bot Personality (`gemini_bot.py` - Lines 27-38)

Fine-tune the AI's communication style and personality:

```python
BOT_PERSONALITY = """
You are responding as the owner of this WhatsApp account. Your responses MUST be:
- EXTREMELY brief - maximum 2 sentences, around 40-60 words total
- Natural and conversational like a real person texting
- Appropriate to the relationship level with the contact
- In the same language as the incoming message
- Never mention you're an AI or analyzing anything
- Keep it casual and human-like, not overly formal or robotic
- Be sarcastic and highly friendly, make interesting conversation
- Drive conversation forward while keeping it cool and engaging
"""
```

**Personality Customization Options:**
- **Response Length**: Adjust word limits and sentence count
- **Tone**: Sarcastic, serious, friendly, professional, instructive
- **Formality Level**: Casual, semi-formal, formal
- **Language Style**: Modern slang, traditional, professional
- **Relationship Awareness**: Family-friendly, friend-casual, professional-formal
**Try out different sytles**
**Example Personality Variations:**

```python
# Professional Personality
BOT_PERSONALITY = """
Professional and courteous responses. Keep formal tone, 
use proper grammar, avoid slang. Be helpful and informative.
"""

# Casual Friend Personality  
BOT_PERSONALITY = """
Casual and friendly like texting a close friend. Use modern slang,
be relaxed and fun. Keep responses short and engaging.
"""

# Sarcastic Personality (Default)
BOT_PERSONALITY = """
Witty and sarcastic responses with friendly undertone. 
Be entertaining while helpful. Use humor appropriately.
"""
```

## Advanced Configuration

### 4. API Configuration

#### Gemini API Setup (`gemini_bot.py`)
```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")  # Set in environment variables
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # Model selection
```

#### OpenRouter API Setup (Alternative)
```python
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")  # Alternative AI provider
```

### 5. Response Behavior Customization

#### Relationship-Based Responses (`gemini_bot.py`)
The system automatically detects relationship levels and adjusts responses:

- **Family**: Warm, caring, emoji usage, faster responses
- **Close Friends**: Casual, slang, friendly tone
- **Friends**: Balanced formality, conversational
- **Acquaintances**: Polite, professional, measured responses

#### Communication Style Analysis
The bot learns from your message history:
- **Message Length**: Adapts to your typical response length
- **Emoji Usage**: Matches your emoji patterns
- **Formality Level**: Learns formal vs casual preferences  
- **Response Speed**: Adjusts based on relationship urgency

### 6. Session Management

#### WhatsApp Session Persistence
- Sessions are automatically saved in `./whatsapp_session/`
- QR code authentication required on first run
- Subsequent runs use saved session data

#### Data Storage Files
- `chat_history.json`: Conversation history for context
- `contact_profiles.json`: Relationship and style analysis
- `ai_introduced.json`: Tracks introduction message status
- `bot_analytics.json`: Usage statistics and patterns
- `communication_style.json`: Global style preferences

## Development & Extension

### Adding New Platforms
The framework is designed for easy extension to additional messaging platforms:

1. Create new bot file (e.g., `telegram_bot.py`)
2. Implement message monitoring and sending
3. Integrate with existing AI response system
4. Add platform-specific configuration options

### Custom Response Filters
Implement custom logic for:
- **Time-based responses**: Different replies based on time of day
- **Location awareness**: Responses based on your location status
- **Mood adaptation**: Adjust tone based on your recent activity
- **Context filtering**: Handle specific keywords or topics differently

### AI Model Integration
Support for multiple AI providers:
- Google Gemini (primary)
- OpenRouter (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Local LLM integration
- Custom model endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **QR Code Authentication**: Ensure WhatsApp Web is logged out on other devices
2. **API Errors**: Verify API keys and internet connection
3. **Group Messages**: Bot automatically ignores group messages for privacy
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent WhatsApp rate limits

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying console.log statements or setting environment variables.
